XmDZEkQ-sGtRQxgygOKRUw,Mindy P.,4,2025-09-20T16:13:06-05:00,"Good vibes overall, but their food is very expensive. We sat on the patio and had live music during lunch, which was a huge plus. Parking was easy to find in the lot across the restaurant, which is free. Food was tasty though, and overall it felt like a good portion size too. Service was okay for the most part."
t2XWav93SQwovk-WOdlkDA,Ultima M.,3,2025-09-12T09:13:09-05:00,"First time here and we found parking right in front YAY We sat in the patio area. We were told that we could not sit at a big table because we were a party of 2 and the big table is for larger parties, that totally makes sense so we moved to a smaller table and waited and waited for a server ...... So finally I went to the bar and ordered our drinks and oyster shooters myself. Bartender was friendly and took our order and asked if we had a server and I said No, and she said she would put our order in, THANK YOU Patio area has a stage with a live band, decor is nice and gives NOLA vibes. This spot is a good spot to pre-game before a baseball game (which is what we came for)"

We sat at a hi-top outside, and it was a perfect evening for it! I had the bloody Mary. A great kick and real flavor! The gator bites has a nice kick, as well. A bit spendy, but it's not every day you eat gator. I had the shrimp and mushroom pasta... beautifully delicious!! The grilled bread could use some butter. Everything else was perfect!!"
Tg3r6XhmgXDUiZryvxtAHw,Deyna J.,5,2025-08-30T13:23:00-05:00,"The menu is very limited for a vegetarian but I always wanted to come here. It's historic and a St. Louis staple. I loved the atmosphere and vibe. We went before a Cardinals game. It wasn't too busy and there was some live music. It was HOT but we sat outside and they have fans that helped a lot with the heat. The food was great, spicy! I had the pasta. The fries were good too. My boyfriend loved his shrimp dish. I would return for drinks, live music and the atmosphere."
cIHVg_gseBYAOpWJvwYV7Q,Matt L.,4,2025-08-18T22:02:52-05:00,"well, i've finally come to broadway oyster. usually i only ever came by this place when i had missed my exit and came too far, thus requiring a turn around right next to this place. there is usually live music going on at night, so i've actually always been curious about this spot i came here with a friend on a friday, and it was fairly busy but we were able to get a seat right away. the parking situation: there is street parking and i think you generally should be fine leaving your car here. there are also some paid parking options nearby, or you can try your luck parking in the white castle across the road I thought the service here was pretty good. i got a red bird which i don't have a strong opinion on. it tasted a bit like gatorade with some alcohol in it, which isn't entirely a bad thing. as for the food, i got the gumbo while my friend got some sort of sandwich thing. you're able to choose from different sizes of gumbo, but i just got the smaller one. overall i thought it was very good we also got some oysters. i guess oysters are pretty expensive (20 for a half dozen, works out to be a little over $3 each), but what can you do? especially living so far from the ocean. i thought they were really good overall, also considering i haven't had oysters in many years im happy i visited, would come again"
eiVTj41K6sRAZjoqSOmjDw,Russ B.,5,2025-08-08T09:59:02-05:00,"This is a StL gem for a reason! The music is great, the food is delicious, and the drinks are perfect on a hot summer day. We were able to get a seat quickly and had a great date night!"
I2Yet2zLLGNPriYvj3f5_Q,Tedd T.,5,2025-08-04T12:20:05-05:00,"Broadway Oyster Bar is the kind of place where you walk in expecting sticky floors and cheap beer--and leave wondering if you accidentally joined a Mardi Gras parade and fell in love with a crawfish. Yes, it's a dive. A beautiful, weird, glorious dive. The decor is a fever dream of New Orleans meets garage sale, the bathroom situation is... historic, and the tables may wobble--but the food? Unreasonably good. Like, ""did I just get spiritually moved by a po'boy?"" good. The oysters are fresh, the Cajun flavors are loud (in a good way), and the jambalaya might just cure whatever existential crisis you're currently battling. The drinks are strong, the staff is friendly in that ""I've seen things"" kind of way, and the live music makes it impossible not to shimmy in your seat--even if you were just here for dinner. It's not polished. It's not quiet. And thank God for that. Broadway Oyster Bar isn't just a restaurant--it's an experience. Come hungry, come weird, and bring napkins. You're gonna need 'em."

We were seated inside this time and we loved the vibe inside! Really cool decor to look at all around. I had the SoCo Hurricane and it was amazing. It was strong but also fruity. My husband had the Blackberry Mule and he loved it. We started with Cajun Tequila wing and they were phenomenal. They were spicy and tangy, crispy and juicy. Everyone LOVED them. I had the chicken Mona, my son the jambalaya, my daughter had the garlic cream linguini, and my husband the pulled pork sliders. Everything was SO GOOD! Insanely good. Our food came out quickly and was hot. Everything was correct and tasted amazing. Our server was amazing, friendly, and we never had empty drinks. She was so helpful and lovely. Can't wait to come back again someday!"

Overall it was a good experience and enjoyed the performance that night. The outdoor seating area is a good touch for liveusic during the warmer months. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was delicious! Everything was perfectly prepared, the shrimp was fresh and the garlic cream sauce was very flavorful. The only downside to the meal was the meal in my opinion was overly priced for the small amount that I was given."
o4fZYpoWltwk1CvFT2vP4A,Amanda M.,5,2019-09-22T18:42:49-05:00,I am SO impressed with the Broadway Oyster Bar! I did the call ahead priority seating and we were seated right when we checked in on a busy Saturday night. Awesome! We ordered the Voodoo shrimp as a starter and it was phenomenal! Our waitress Carly (I hope I didn't spell that wrong) recommended the Hurricane drink and that was spot on as well. Carly was super friendly and helpful. She found the time on a busy Saturday to get to know our table and we appreciated that. I was stuck between two main dishes and she persuaded me to the crawfish mona dish. WOW! Carly-thank you SO much. This meal was amazing and I will dream about it back in Michigan. I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp. 10/10 we will be back someday. Your waitress Carly is a gem!
i7VSpTiNdBSaW-snl-oCMA,Gwennita W.,,,"I came to Sister Cities Cajun to celebrate my birthday with my family and friends. The food was awesome. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the catfish basket with fries and a side of jambalya with cornbread. Plus a Hurricane. Shout out to Jay, he provided great customer service. He was very personable. He even played Happy Birthday by Stevie Wonder for me and Last Dance by Donna Summer which made my mother get up and dance! Everything was clean and decorated nicely. I'm going back again."
lHAbTCxdGMPXzGRKQl2NFg,Jennifer E.,,,This is one of those hidden gems. Service was amazing. Food was to die for. Was trying to determine what to get and the server helped by letting me substitute gumbo in place of dirty rice. Ambiance has the new Orleans vibe with the music playing.
88-U_Q27jLyljtFqm7AtFg,Eva J.,,,"We'd stopped in here after another nearby restaurant was closing for the night. We followed the music and it lead us inside. I had never been but it was a place I've wanted to try and I'm so glad we did. Our server Sequoia was so kind, helpful and attentive. Both of us got the creole burger and since we didnt know what to expect, we thought it would just be ok but this was one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. Absolutely delicious, perfectly seasoned and juicy. My only dislike was that the bacon I added on was a bit sweet for my liking so I wouldnt get that again. They also don't have yellow cheese (American/cheddar) so I got parmesan which was surprisly good. The masked potatoes were good and homemade but maybe a tad heavy on the sour cream flavor. The fries were out of this world. They were a bit spicy but perfectly and deliciously seasoned. I couldn't stop eating off of my bfs plate. I absolutely CANNOT wait to go back!"
i9uqWUQ47bNRMD92jAx7Yg,Keith J.,,,"This past visit to Hwy 61 Roadhouse in Webster Groves I discovered a new favorite dish that is the beef brisket sandwich that was cheesy, meaty and delectable. This wasn't my first rodeo at Hwy 61 Roadhouse and there's things I like that keep me coming back but there's a few things I don't like as much such as the smoked chicken plate I ate on a previous visit and so deducting one star for my review. Things I love there are: cheeseburgers, BBQ Sampler entree, onion rings, wings, red beans n rice, and smoked spaghetti as a side dish although I probably wouldn't order as an entree. Dishes I don't like much as much are the aforementioned smoked fried chicken, gumbo, and jambalaya that's okay but had better elsewhere. But this place to me is one of the coolest restaurant spaces in the Lou with lots of memorabilia, a Guy Fieri DDD endorsement, and many years ago I use to shop there when it was a Streetside Records store. Nice servers and never had an issue with service."
M4K_QnropJJifYEV6OB9Mg,Erica H.,,,"The best Cajun restaurant I have tried outside of Louisiana! I didn't expect it to be this delicious when we came, but the flavor was the freshness was perfect. They provided gloves and apron to put over your clothes, but my gloves broke half way through the meal. Maybe get an extra pair in advance. Besides the tasty food, our order took much longer than other customers who arrived later than us. It was quite busy during that time, but the wait was about 30 minutes for us to get the seafood."
iTZe5j6682Lkh-qjHUlwiA,Erika H.,,,"4 Hens is located inside the City Foundry. They have an extensive creole inspired menu. Pricing for the food is a little on the expensive side. The food I saw other customers getting looked delicious and was decent portion sizes. I didn't try any food, I did however purchase strawberry tea and an Arnold Palmer. The strawberry the had strawberry puree added to it. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The Arnold Palmer was made perfectly. You could taste the lemonade more than the tea.. For it to not be busy, service was a little slow.ill come back to try some food."
EfCj8sZc1uBJm8B6Ye5A0Q,Steven B.,,,"Lucky for me, I follow Gumbo 2 Geaux on Facebook. That way, I know what daily specials they are having. The other day the special was, Clam Strips and anyone who truly knows me, knows that I am a huge fan of Clam Strips. I could not get out to the Rav4 fast enough, to go get my lunch. The Clam Strip Basket included, clam strips, seasoned wedges, hush puppies and Gigi's apple slaw. It came with two sauces, remoulade and cocktail. The clams strips were super crispy. I wish the seasoned wedges were half as crispy, because they were a little on the wimp side for, but the flavor was good. The hush puppies get two thumbs up, I dipped one in the remoulade and the other in the cocktail and I'm not a dipper. Both sauces tasted so good, I am going to assume they are house made. When I saw Gigi's Apple Slaw listed as one of the sides I'll admit, I scratched my head. To my delight, I was pleasantly surprised. It had a unique taste to it and was a nice change from the typical coleslaw. Had me wondering, is I could buy it in quarts for a summer BBQ. I like how the counter and dining room shows their roots and connection to NOL and LSU. The counter girl seemed a little shy, but her service was good and she asked all the right questions. The regular menu is always good, but I recommend that you start following them on Facebook to know the daily specials."
1HT2kiAsfWetro52OosoIg,Rashida G.,,,"I had such a wonderful time here! Jenny at the bar was incredible--attentive, kind, and went above and beyond to accommodate my severe shellfish allergy. It's not every day you find a restaurant that takes food allergies this seriously, and I felt genuinely safe dining here. The food itself was flavorful and well-prepared, the cocktails were perfectly balanced (and yes, they packed a nice punch!), and the atmosphere was the perfect mix of laid-back and lively. As someone who usually has to stress about cross-contamination, I can't express how refreshing it was to relax and fully enjoy my meal. Highly recommend--especially if you have dietary restrictions and want peace of mind with your delicious food!"
eonKEjrM5OjzWXhz4VTXLA,Dani C.,,,"Authentic creole spot at the grove and warm hospitality! It's my first time trying this restaurant, and I had a great experience. The food was absolutely delicious. The spices are well combined and just on point. Highly recommended."
