Everything I go I always try a new dish and I haven't been disappointed as of yet. This place is a St. Louis staple please try.",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$
XmDZEkQ-sGtRQxgygOKRUw,Mindy P.,4,2025-09-20T16:13:06-05:00,"Good vibes overall, but their food is very expensive. We sat on the patio and had live music during lunch, which was a huge plus. Parking was easy to find in the lot across the restaurant, which is free. Food was tasty though, and overall it felt like a good portion size too. Service was okay for the most part.",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

We were told that we could not sit at a big table because we were a party of 2 and the big table is for larger parties, that totally makes sense so we moved to a smaller table and waited and waited for a server ...... So finally I went to the bar and ordered our drinks and oyster shooters myself. Bartender was friendly and took our order and asked if we had a server and I said No, and she said she would put our order in, THANK YOU Patio area has a stage with a live band, decor is nice and gives NOLA vibes. This spot is a good spot to pre-game before a baseball game (which is what we came for)",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

We sat at a hi-top outside, and it was a perfect evening for it! I had the bloody Mary. A great kick and real flavor! The gator bites has a nice kick, as well. A bit spendy, but it's not every day you eat gator. I had the shrimp and mushroom pasta... beautifully delicious!! The grilled bread could use some butter. Everything else was perfect!!",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

I loved the atmosphere and vibe. We went before a Cardinals game. It wasn't too busy and there was some live music. It was HOT but we sat outside and they have fans that helped a lot with the heat. The food was great, spicy! I had the pasta. The fries were good too. My boyfriend loved his shrimp dish. I would return for drinks, live music and the atmosphere.",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$
cIHVg_gseBYAOpWJvwYV7Q,Matt L.,4,2025-08-18T22:02:52-05:00,"well, i've finally come to broadway oyster. usually i only ever came by this place when i had missed my exit and came too far, thus requiring a turn around right next to this place. there is usually live music going on at night, so i've actually always been curious about this spot i came here with a friend on a friday, and it was fairly busy but we were able to get a seat right away. the parking situation: there is street parking and i think you generally should be fine leaving your car here. there are also some paid parking options nearby, or you can try your luck parking in the white castle across the road I thought the service here was pretty good. i got a red bird which i don't have a strong opinion on. it tasted a bit like gatorade with some alcohol in it, which isn't entirely a bad thing. as for the food, i got the gumbo while my friend got some sort of sandwich thing. you're able to choose from different sizes of gumbo, but i just got the smaller one. overall i thought it was very good we also got some oysters. i guess oysters are pretty expensive (20 for a half dozen, works out to be a little over $3 each), but what can you do? especially living so far from the ocean. i thought they were really good overall, also considering i haven't had oysters in many years im happy i visited, would come again",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

I2Yet2zLLGNPriYvj3f5_Q,Tedd T.,5,2025-08-04T12:20:05-05:00,"Broadway Oyster Bar is the kind of place where you walk in expecting sticky floors and cheap beer--and leave wondering if you accidentally joined a Mardi Gras parade and fell in love with a crawfish. Yes, it's a dive. A beautiful, weird, glorious dive. The decor is a fever dream of New Orleans meets garage sale, the bathroom situation is... historic, and the tables may wobble--but the food? Unreasonably good. Like, ""did I just get spiritually moved by a po'boy?"" good. The oysters are fresh, the Cajun flavors are loud (in a good way), and the jambalaya might just cure whatever existential crisis you're currently battling. The drinks are strong, the staff is friendly in that ""I've seen things"" kind of way, and the live music makes it impossible not to shimmy in your seat--even if you were just here for dinner. It's not polished. It's not quiet. And thank God for that. Broadway Oyster Bar isn't just a restaurant--it's an experience. Come hungry, come weird, and bring napkins. You're gonna need 'em.",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

We were seated inside this time and we loved the vibe inside! Really cool decor to look at all around. I had the SoCo Hurricane and it was amazing. It was strong but also fruity. My husband had the Blackberry Mule and he loved it. We started with Cajun Tequila wing and they were phenomenal. They were spicy and tangy, crispy and juicy. Everyone LOVED them. I had the chicken Mona, my son the jambalaya, my daughter had the garlic cream linguini, and my husband the pulled pork sliders. Everything was SO GOOD! Insanely good. Our food came out quickly and was hot. Everything was correct and tasted amazing. Our server was amazing, friendly, and we never had empty drinks. She was so helpful and lovely. Can't wait to come back again someday!",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$

Overall it was a good experience and enjoyed the performance that night. The outdoor seating area is a good touch for liveusic during the warmer months. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was delicious! Everything was perfectly prepared, the shrimp was fresh and the garlic cream sauce was very flavorful. The only downside to the meal was the meal in my opinion was overly priced for the small amount that I was given.",Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$
o4fZYpoWltwk1CvFT2vP4A,Amanda M.,5,2019-09-22T18:42:49-05:00,I am SO impressed with the Broadway Oyster Bar! I did the call ahead priority seating and we were seated right when we checked in on a busy Saturday night. Awesome! We ordered the Voodoo shrimp as a starter and it was phenomenal! Our waitress Carly (I hope I didn't spell that wrong) recommended the Hurricane drink and that was spot on as well. Carly was super friendly and helpful. She found the time on a busy Saturday to get to know our table and we appreciated that. I was stuck between two main dishes and she persuaded me to the crawfish mona dish. WOW! Carly-thank you SO much. This meal was amazing and I will dream about it back in Michigan. I'm so glad I found this place on Yelp. 10/10 we will be back someday. Your waitress Carly is a gem!,Broadway Oyster Bar,4.4,2721,$$
