Forgot to take pics until halfway through our entrees, whoops! But nothing was disappointing. We got the cheddar biscuits which were good, a more moist version of red lobsters biscuits, not a bad thing imo! \nThe lobster roll was good, but just a lobster roll, nothing special. Crab fritters were delightful and unique, and the chili glazed pork belly was our favorite app. \nWe got the pork chop and short rib entrees which were both equally delicious. And for dessert we did the pineapple upside down bread pudding. Also amazing, very moist, not too dry. I would return. And would consider going for more of a tapas experience too as a lot of their apps/small plates looked good!",

Caesar salads were dubbed different but acceptable.  \nBad news Bear\nMenu can't decide if this is fine dining or simply an overpriced cwe trendy hot spot.    Could perhaps be both with more yakitori concept dishes at lower prices.   Think 1 skewer for $6-$7 then 2 for $13.   4 for $20.   Mix and match yields more $$$    Beef.  Octopus.  Pork belly.   The opportunity is there to pair with fav cocktail  and set up street carts for the late night crowds.   \nLastly and sorry to say, oversauced and oversalted salmon is not the way.

There is a public parking garage next door or you can street park if you are lucky enough to find a spot. Atmosphere is cozy with dim lighting. It was a little noisy making to hear everyone at our table of 6. The menu is very eclectic with a variety of very creative food choices. I went with the fish skewers (on menu as salmon, however, this night was halibut). Beautifully plated with a small side of slaw (? Not sure what to call it? Kinda pickly) Sauce was tangy with a little heat. Very good. Also, had the brussel sprouts. Very good! For dessert, my husband and I split the Pineapple Upside Down Bread Pudding. A must try!

The food was excellent! What stood out for me was the watermelon salad. Never had anything like it. I definitely want to return and sit outside.\n\nWe wanted to go to have drinks at Lazy Tiger but they couldn't seat our 5 person group. We were told that Yellowbelly had more seating and a larger bar, so we walked over. I believe they have the same owners. We sat at the bar and only ordered drinks. The drinks we ordered were Lazy Tiger, Word of Mouth and Kiwi Pisco Sour. I had a Word of Mouth. It was very good, more sour than I thought it would be which was good. I tasted the Lazy Tiger. It had a Smokey flavor, I didn't like it. My boyfriend wasn't sure about it after the first sip but did like it as he kept drinking it. I liked the ambiance and vibe of the restaurant.

Like, \"did I just get spiritually moved by a po'boy?\" good.\n\nThe oysters are fresh, the Cajun flavors are loud (in a good way), and the jambalaya might just cure whatever existential crisis you're currently battling. The drinks are strong, the staff is friendly in that \"I've seen things\" kind of way, and the live music makes it impossible not to shimmy in your seat--even if you were just here for dinner.\n\nIt's not polished.

Sadly, no.\n\nIn 2017, I was in St. Louis for a Coheed and Cambria concert and discovered Blueprint Coffee. Unfortunately, they closed 5 minutes before I got there. So, I made a mental note to visit it the next time I was in town.\n\nFast forward to 2018 and I am in town again to see a Cardinals game with my mom. We only had a few minutes to grab some coffee before the game, so we were in and out super quick.\n\nSo... why isn't Blueprint a blue print for coffee shops? The interior was pretty plain. Not that that is bad. It's just very plain with no d\u00e9cor. We don't visit coffeehouses for the d\u00e9cor or paint colors. We visit them for coffee.\n\nHow was the coffee? It was interesting. I ordered a Tekton v12, which according to the menu was a 'Colombia/Guatemala' filtered coffee. It had a hint of chestnut, I think. It was alright. Not something I would order again but not bad enough to not finish.\n\nThe whole menu, which was on an awkward clipboard, is weird. It was kind of hard to decipher and figure out how to order a plain black coffee. I'd definitely recommend them having a bit more cohesive and a better laid out menu. They also offered teas and food but since we were in a rush, I didn't get a chance to see what they offered.\n\nLast but not least... the customer service. The barista must have been having a bad day or something because he showed no enthusiasm when I placed my order and when he handed it to me. That whole mood of 'you aren't welcome here' was actually felt throughout the entire place. Now maybe it was because I was on a time restraint, but I definitely was happy to leave the place.\n\nNow with the disclaimer. Just because I had a 'less-than-stellar' experience here doesn't mean you should avoid it. The online reviews are great and the place was packed when I was there. They opened a 2nd location, so business must be going great. Go there, try it yourself and form your own opinion.",
